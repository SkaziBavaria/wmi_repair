# WMI Repair Script
This script repairs the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) components on your system, which can fix various issues related to software installation, system configuration, and more.

## Requirements
- Windows operating system
- PowerShell 5.1 or later

## Usage
1. Open PowerShell as an administrator
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved
3. Run the script by entering the following command: .\wmi_repair.ps1

## What the Script Does
The script performs the following actions:

1. Checks for administrative privileges
2. Stops the WMI service
3. Re-registers the WMI components
4. Starts the WMI service
5. Verifies if the WMI service has started successfully

## Troubleshooting
If the script fails to stop the WMI service, it will attempt to force stop it using the Stop-Process cmdlet. If this also fails, you can try stopping the service manually through the Services tool.

If the script fails to re-register the WMI components or start the WMI service, it will display an error message indicating the failure.
